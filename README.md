# Hello World Patch Project

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use radare2 to modify a compiled C++ binary and generate a JSON patch. It includes:

- An original C++ source file (`hello.cpp`) that prints “Hello World!”
- A compiled binary of `hello.cpp` (`hello`)
- A modified binary (`hacked`) where the output string has been changed to “Hacked World!”
- A JSON patch file (`patchHW.json`) generated by comparing the original and modified binaries

## Files
- `hello.cpp`  
  The C++ source code:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>

  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
  }
hello
The compiled executable generated from hello.cpp. Running this binary prints “Hello World!” to the console.

hacked
A binary that was created by opening hello in radare2 and patching the string at address 0x9C1 to “Hacked World!”. Running this binary prints “Hacked World!” to the console.

patchHW.json
A JSON patch file created by running radiff2 -u hello hacked > patchHW.json. This file contains the diff information between the original and modified binaries.

Prerequisites
radare2
A reverse-engineering framework used to inspect and patch binaries.

radiff2
A component of the radare2 suite, used to generate binary diffs in JSON or other formats.

A C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to build hello.cpp.

Building the Original Binary
Open a terminal in the project directory.

Compile hello.cpp into an executable named hello:


g++ hello.cpp -o hello
Verify that running hello prints “Hello World!”:


./hello
Patching with radare2
Open the original binary in radare2:


r2 -w hello
The -w flag opens the binary in write mode, allowing modifications.

Seek to the address 0x9C1, which corresponds to the string “Hello World!” in the binary:


[0x00000000]> s 0x9C1
Use the patch command to overwrite “Hello World!” with “Hacked World!”:


[0x000009c1]> w "Hacked World!"
Save the patched binary as hacked and exit radare2:


[0x000009c1]> wq!
When prompted, choose to save changes. Rename or copy the modified file to hacked.

Verify that running hacked prints “Hacked World!”:


./hacked
Generating the JSON Patch
Use radiff2 to compare the original and patched binaries and output a JSON-formatted diff:


radiff2 -u hello hacked > patchHW.json
The file patchHW.json now contains the diff information, including changed offsets, lengths, and new byte values.

Usage
To apply the patch to another copy of hello, you can use utilities that consume patchHW.json (for example, r2pm plugins or custom scripts).

To inspect the differences manually, open patchHW.json in a text editor or use JSON viewers.
