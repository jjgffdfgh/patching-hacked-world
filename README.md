# Patching Hacked World üõ†Ô∏èüåç

Welcome to the **Patching Hacked World** repository! This project demonstrates how to utilize Radare2 on a Raspberry Pi 4 running ARM64 with Kali Linux. Here, you will learn how to patch a simple "Hello World" binary, generate a JSON-formatted diff using radiff2, and produce a JSON-formatted disassembly of the patched executable.

## Introduction

In the world of cybersecurity, understanding how to patch binaries is crucial. This repository serves as a guide to help you navigate the process of binary patching using Radare2. By following the steps outlined here, you will gain hands-on experience with reverse engineering and binary analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Raspberry Pi 4**: This project is tailored for the Raspberry Pi 4 running ARM64 architecture.
- **Kali Linux**: This is the operating system we will use. Make sure it is installed and up to date.
- **Radare2**: You need to install Radare2 for binary analysis and patching. Follow the installation instructions in the [Radare2 documentation](https://rada.re/n/radare2/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjgffdfgh/patching-hacked-world.git
   cd patching-hacked-world
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install radare2
   ```

## Usage

Once you have everything set up, you can start patching the binary. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

1. **Navigate to the Binary**

   Locate the binary you want to patch. In this case, it is a simple "Hello World" executable.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/binary
   ```

2. **Open the Binary with Radare2**

   Launch Radare2 with the binary:

   ```bash
   r2 -w hello_world
   ```

3. **Patch the Binary**

   You can now modify the binary as needed. For example, you might want to change the string "Hello World" to "Hello Universe".

   Use the following command in Radare2:

   ```bash
   s main
   wx "Hello Universe" @ str.ptr
   ```

4. **Save the Changes**

   After making your changes, save the binary:

   ```bash
   wq
   ```

## Generating JSON Diff

After patching the binary, you can generate a JSON-formatted diff using radiff2. This will help you visualize the changes made.

1. **Run radiff2**

   Use the following command to generate the diff:

   ```bash
   radiff2 -j hello_world original_hello_world
   ```

2. **View the JSON Output**

   The output will be in JSON format, showing the differences between the original and patched binaries. Save this output for your records.

## Disassembling the Patched Executable

To disassemble the patched executable and produce a JSON-formatted output, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Patched Binary in Radare2**

   Launch Radare2 with the patched binary:

   ```bash
   r2 -A hello_world
   ```

2. **Generate Disassembly**

   Use the following command to create a disassembly of the patched executable:

   ```bash
   pdd @ main
   ```

3. **Export to JSON**

   Finally, export the disassembly in JSON format:

   ```bash
   pdd @ main -j
   ```
